Delta Lake with Databricks - Study Materials and Projects
Welcome to my repository where I have shared the study materials and hands-on projects that I developed after completing the Delta Lake with Databricks course. This comprehensive course enhanced my skills in leveraging Delta Lake for data engineering projects, utilizing Databricks for analytics, and building real-time data pipelines.

What I've Learned
Throughout this course, I have covered several core concepts of Delta Lake, a revolutionary storage layer that ensures ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unification of data lakes and data warehouses. I also explored Databricks, a powerful platform that enhances the capabilities of Delta Lake by integrating PySpark for data processing and Delta Live Tables for creating ETL pipelines.

Topics Covered:
Unity Catalog: Learn how to manage and govern your data assets with Unity Catalog in Databricks.
ACID Transactions: Implemented and understood the significance of ACID transactions for ensuring data consistency and integrity in Delta Lake.
External vs Managed Delta Tables: Gained practical experience in creating and using both external and managed Delta tables.
Optimization Techniques: Mastered techniques for optimizing performance in Databricks, including the use of ZORDER BY and Liquid Clustering.
Structured Streaming with PySpark: Applied structured streaming concepts for real-time data processing and analytics using PySpark.
Delta Live Tables (ETL Pipelines): Learned how to create, manage, and optimize ETL pipelines with Delta Live Tables in Databricks.
Technologies and Tools Used:
Delta Lake: A storage layer built on Apache Spark, enabling ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and more.
Databricks: A collaborative platform for Apache Spark-based data analytics and engineering.
Azure: Cloud environment used to provision resources like Databricks and storage.
PySpark: Python API for Spark, utilized for real-time data processing and analytics.
Delta Live Tables: Databricks framework for building and automating ETL pipelines.
Key Concepts Implemented:
ACID Transactions: Applied the ACID properties in Delta Lake to ensure consistent, reliable data.
Time Travel: Used Delta Lake's Time Travel feature to query and restore historical data versions.
Schema Enforcement and Evolution: Implemented schema enforcement and managed schema evolution to ensure data consistency across processing jobs.
ETL Pipelines with Delta Live Tables: Created end-to-end ETL pipelines for efficient data processing and transformation using Delta Live Tables.
Learning Journey:
In this repository, you will find a collection of notebooks, scripts, and other materials that I used while learning Delta Lake and Databricks. These materials document my hands-on projects, where I applied theoretical concepts to real-world data engineering scenarios. The projects primarily focus on data integrity, optimization, and real-time streaming with Delta Lake, all powered by Databricks.
