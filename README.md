# Delta Lake with Databricks - Study Materials and Projects

Welcome to my repository! Here, I share the study materials and hands-on projects I developed after completing the **Delta Lake with Databricks** course. This course helped me strengthen my skills in using **Delta Lake** for data engineering, leveraging **Databricks** for analytics, and creating ETL pipelines using **Delta Live Tables**.

---

## What I've Learned

Throughout this course, I explored various features of **Delta Lake**, a storage layer that offers ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies data lakes and data warehouses. I also worked with **Databricks** to enhance the power of Delta Lake, including using **PySpark** for data processing and building **Delta Live Tables** for ETL pipelines.

## Topics Covered

Hereâ€™s a summary of the core concepts I learned and implemented:

### 1. **Unity Catalog**
   - Managed and governed data assets effectively using **Unity Catalog** in Databricks.

### 2. **ACID Transactions in Delta Lake**
   - Ensured data consistency and integrity through **ACID transactions**.

### 3. **External vs Managed Delta Tables**
   - Implemented both **External Delta Tables** and **Managed Delta Tables**, and explored their use cases.

### 4. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Learned how to optimize performance using techniques like **ZORDER BY** and **Liquid Clustering** in Databricks.

### 5. **Structured Streaming with PySpark**
   - Worked on real-time data processing and analytics using **Structured Streaming** with **PySpark**.

### 6. **Delta Live Tables (ETL Pipelines)**
   - Created and managed **ETL pipelines** with **Delta Live Tables** in Databricks.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Delta Lake**: A storage layer built on top of Apache Spark providing ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and more.
- **Databricks**: A collaborative platform for Apache Spark-based data analytics and engineering.
- **Azure**: Cloud environment used to provision resources like Databricks and storage.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Apache Spark, used for data processing and real-time analytics.
- **Delta Live Tables**: A Databricks framework to automate ETL pipelines.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **ACID Transactions**
   - Applied **ACID transactions** to ensure data consistency and integrity in Delta Lake.

### 2. **Time Travel**
   - Used Delta Lake's **Time Travel** feature to query and restore historical versions of data.

### 3. **Schema Enforcement & Evolution**
   - Enforced schema on write and handled **schema evolution** within the data pipelines.

### 4. **ETL Pipelines with Delta Live Tables**
   - Built efficient **ETL pipelines** using **Delta Live Tables** for real-time data processing and transformation.
