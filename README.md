I have covered several core concepts related to Delta Lake, a revolutionary storage layer that provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies data lakes and data warehouses. It also explored Databricks as a powerful platform for working with Delta Lake, PySpark, and building ETL pipelines using Delta Live Tables.

Topics Covered:
Here’s a summary of the main concepts and skills I have learned and implemented throughout the course:
      Unity Catalog: Managed and governed data assets effectively using Unity Catalog.
      ACID Transactions in Delta Lake: Ensured data consistency and integrity through ACID transactions.
      External vs Managed Delta Tables: Explored and implemented both external and managed Delta tables.
      Optimization Techniques: Learned how to optimize performance in Databricks using techniques like ZORDER BY and Liquid Clustering.
      Structured Streaming with PySpark: Worked on real-time data processing and analytics using Structured Streaming.
      Delta Live Tables: Created and managed ETL pipelines using Delta Live Tables in Databricks.
Technologies and Tools Used:
      Delta Lake: A storage layer built on top of Apache Spark, providing ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and more.
      Databricks: Platform for collaborative Apache Spark-based data analytics.
      Azure: Cloud services used for provisioning resources like Databricks and storage.
      PySpark: Python API for Apache Spark, used for data processing and streaming.
      Delta Live Tables: A framework in Databricks for building and managing ETL pipelines.
Key Features Implemented:
      ACID Transactions: Applied Delta Lake’s ACID transaction features to ensure data integrity and reliability in the data lake.
      Time Travel: Used Delta Lake’s time travel capabilities to query and restore previous versions of data.
      Schema Enforcement & Evolution: Enforced schema on write and handled schema evolution as part of the data pipeline.
      ETL Pipelines with Delta Live Tables: Built efficient ETL pipelines using Delta Live Tables for data processing workflows.

Learning Journey:
Through this repository, I’ve not only implemented theoretical knowledge but also worked on practical use cases to reinforce my learning. The projects focus on solving real-world data engineering problems using Delta Lake on Databricks.
